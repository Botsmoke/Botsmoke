- 👋 Hi, I’m @Botsmoke
- 👀 I’m interested in more about games and their modes, but being able to understand something about software is I guess it's best to try to do it yourself ..
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Best looking from the side when the best make code! I think (these all sorts of beliefs when there is no knowledge) would imagine learning to understand
What more complex software looks like when I see one being born
After that, I might hope to be able to create something with it myself some Day.. It would be cool to know how to fix some error code when you see one sometimes again when you have decided to mess ure PC
Because of the new coolest Linux release 👍😄
- And i looking Going forward that someone’s patience was enough to advise me, I was last in school at an information technology class in a two-week computer courseand just a few things to remember well, Hyperlink maybe😄
e

- Thanks if interested;))
